3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- üìä **Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì Main data visualization and dashboard creation platform  
- üìÇ **Power Query** ‚Äì Used for data cleaning, importing, and shaping raw datasets for analysis  
- üß† **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì Used for calculated measures such as revenue, trip count, and frequency analysis  
- üõ¢Ô∏è **SQL (via Power Query M Language)** ‚Äì Concepts of joins, filtering, and aggregation were applied during data transformation  
- üîó **Data Modeling** ‚Äì Relationships established among Trip Details, Location Table, and Calendar Table  
- üìÅ **File Format** ‚Äì `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard previews

4. Data Source

**Source:** Mock dataset for Uber ride details (simulated for analytical purposes).  
The dataset includes ride records with the following columns:

- Trip ID  
- Pickup Time  
- Dropoff Time  
- Pickup Location ID  
- Dropoff Location ID  
- Fare Amount  
- Date  

The data was joined with a Location Table and Calendar Table to provide readable location names and date hierarchies for time-based analysis.

5. Features / Highlights

**Business Problem**  
In large cities, Uber collects massive volumes of ride data daily. However, decision-makers often struggle to answer questions like:
- What are the most frequent drop-off or pickup zones?  
- During which hours does demand peak?  
- Which locations generate the highest revenue?

Raw data makes it difficult to extract actionable insights efficiently.

**Goal of the Dashboard**  
To deliver an interactive dashboard that:
- Identifies peak ride times and trip density  
- Highlights high-demand and high-revenue locations  
- Analyzes ride frequency patterns by time and place  
- Supports dispatch planning, marketing efforts, and city-level transportation decisions

**Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

- **Top KPIs (Top Cards):**  
  - Total Rides  
  - Total Revenue  
  - Average Fare per Ride  
  - Unique Locations Covered  

- **Most Frequent Drop-off Location (DAX):**  
  A custom DAX measure identifies the most frequently occurring drop-off location using relationship-based logic.

- **Rides per Hour ‚Äì Line Chart:**  
  Displays ride frequency across a 24-hour cycle to identify peak demand hours.

- **Location-wise Drop-off Volume ‚Äì Bar Chart:**  
  Highlights total drop-offs per location, joined with readable names.

- **Filtering Options:**  
  - Date Range Slicer  
  - Hour Filter  
  - Location Filter

- **Custom DAX Measures:**  
  - Used `USERELATIONSHIP`, `CALCULATE`, and other DAX functions for frequency and revenue logic
